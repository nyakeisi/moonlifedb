# MoonlifeDB: a new way to work with databases.

## What's new?

Version: **1.0 ALPHA 1** <br />
See full documentation: https://nyakeisi.github.io/moonlifedb (LATER) <br />

So, we made this one pretty fast. Still doesnt work properly. <br />
Currently working on `Database#edit()` method: fixing pointers. <br />
Also we made a Snowflake class so you can generate your own snowflake unique ID. <br />
Yep, we are also working on binary version of this database.  <br /> <br />
Stay tuned!
